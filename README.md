- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during data loading

## Technologies Used

- **React 19**: For building the user interface
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Vite**: For fast development and optimized builds
- **CSS Modules**: For component-scoped styling
- **JSONPlaceholder API**: For fetching mock user data

## API Documentation

The application uses the JSONPlaceholder API to fetch user data:

- **Endpoint**: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`
- **Method**: GET
- **Response**: Array of user objects with the following structure:
  ```typescript
  interface User {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    username: string;
    email: string;
    address: {
      street: string;
      suite: string;
      city: string;
      zipcode: string;
      geo: {
        lat: string;
        lng: string;
      }
    };
    phone: string;
    website: string;
    company: {
      name: string;
      catchPhrase: string;
      bs: string;
    }
  }
  ```

## Component Structure

- **App**: Main application component that manages state and renders child components
- **UserList**: Displays users in a tabular format with options to view details or delete
